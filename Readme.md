Queue System Project Review
This is a web-based queue management system with two main components:

Public Kiosk (index.html, script.js, style.css): A simple interface for users to select a service category and get a ticket number.

Staff Interface (display.php, display.js, display.css, login.html, login.js, login.css): A password-protected area for staff to view the queue, call the next ticket, and reset the queue.

Core Functionality:
Authentication: A login system (login.html, auth.php) for staff.

Queue Management:

get_ticket.php: Generates a new ticket number for a selected category.

display_data.php: Provides real-time queue data to the staff display.

call_next.php: Marks the next ticket as "called".

reset_queue.php: Clears the entire queue.

Database: A MySQL database (queue_db) with a tickets table to store queue information and a staff table for user authentication.

Text-to-Speech Feature üó£Ô∏è
Voice Announcements: The system integrates a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature to audibly announce the called ticket number for enhanced accessibility.

API Integration: It utilizes the external AI for Thai (VAJA) API for high-quality, natural-sounding Thai voice synthesis.

Backend Handler (generate_speech.php): A dedicated PHP script handles the TTS workflow:

Receives text from the staff interface (display.js).

Calls the VAJA API to generate an audio file from the text.

Downloads the generated audio file (.wav) to the local server.

Returns the local URL of the audio file to the frontend.

Frontend Player (display.js): The staff interface dynamically creates and plays the audio file upon successfully calling a ticket.

Security:
A security review was performed and the following fixes were implemented:

Password Hashing: A script (hash_passwords.php) was added to hash the passwords in the staff table.

Authentication: Authentication checks were added to the call_next.php and reset_queue.php scripts.

Session Management: A session fixation vulnerability was fixed in auth.php.

Recommendations:
Database Credentials: The db_connect.php file is using default "root" credentials, which is a major security risk. You should create a dedicated database user with limited permissions and use those credentials instead.

User Management: The system is lacking a user registration or password management feature. You should consider adding a way for administrators to manage staff accounts.

Error Handling: The error messages are in Thai, which is good for the users, but for development and debugging, it would be better to have more detailed error logging on the server side.

This project is a good example of a simple, functional web application. The code is well-structured and easy to understand. By addressing the remaining security recommendations, you can make it a robust and secure system.
